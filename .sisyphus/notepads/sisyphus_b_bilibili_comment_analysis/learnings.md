## Frontend Implementation
- Used `recharts` for visualization on the Report page (Radar and Bar charts).
- Implemented Glassmorphism UI using custom CSS variables and Tailwind utility composition.
- Created a consistent gradient background across the app.
- Mocked data flows for Confirm, Progress, and Report pages to allow UI verification without backend.
- Used `ResponsiveContainer` from recharts to ensure charts scale well within the glass cards.
